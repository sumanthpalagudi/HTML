            <p>There are several ways to start using jQuery on your web site. You can:</p>
            <ul id="waytodown">
                <li>Download the jQuery library from jQuery.com</li>
                <li>Include jQuery from a CDN, like Google</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="head2">
            <h1>Downloading jQuery</h1>
            <p>There are two versions of jQuery available for downloading:</p>
            <ul id="downlist">
                <li>Production version - this is for your live website because it has been minified and compressed</li>
                <li>Development version - this is for testing and development (uncompressed and readable code)</li>

            </ul>
            <p>Both versions can be downloaded from jQuery.com.</p>
            <p>The jQuery library is a single JavaScript file, and you reference it with the HTML <span>script</span> tag (notice that the <span>script</span> tag should be inside the <span>head</span> section):</p>
        </div>
        <div id="head3">
            <h1 id="hh3">jQuery CDN</h1>
            <p>If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).</p>
        </div>
        <div id="head4">
            <b>One big advantage of using the hosted jQuery from Google:</b><br>
            <p>Many users already have downloaded jQuery from Google when visiting another site. As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.</p>
