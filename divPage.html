		<p>Vidyanikethan Education Trust (SVET) was established in 1992, it has surpassed many a milestone. As an individual, I have the best memories and biggest learning experiences in life. I believe every individual deserves best knowledge to lead a better life and knowledge comes with learning â€“ one that is based on doing things right and not merely knowing about how to do them. Learning solutions should be relative to real life, thereby motivating the learner towards gaining and applying the imbibed knowledge, disconnecting the superficial parts and connecting sensible aspects.</p>
